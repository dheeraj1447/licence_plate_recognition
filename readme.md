Simply double click on the appropriate .exe file to run the project.

Once the UI opens, follow the steps given below:

This should display the image and the timestamp details of when the image was uploaded.

2. Upload the same image, i.e. test - 1 image by clicking on "Exit Gate" button.
This should give a prompt displaying information about the recognized license plate and total payment to be made.

3. Close the GUI executable, and run it again, repeat step - 1, and then upload test - 2 image.
This should give a prompt that the recognized license plates are not identical.
